# StructGenie

## Overview
StructGenie is a Python package developed as part of a collaborative research project aimed at generating idealized ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) using advanced computational methods. The project leverages mathematical and deep learning approaches to provide insights into the diverse conformations and interactions of IDPs, which play a crucial role in various diseases. StructGenie is designed to support researchers in drug discovery, drug effectiveness predictions, and pharmacokinetic investigations by offering tools for molecular dynamics simulations, cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, and Voronoi tessellation.

## Features
- **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Utilize simulations to explore the conformational space of IDPs.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Group similar conformations to identify predominant structures.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplify complex simulation data for easier analysis and visualization.
- **Voronoi Tessellation**: Analyze spatial relationships and properties of atoms within proteins.
- **NMR Parameter Calculations**: Compute NMR parameters for comparison with experimental data.
